# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
For this project, we were tasked with helping Maria take care of some innaccurate/dishonest data in regards to grades for students in Thomas High School. We looked at the average math scores, average reading scores, the passing scores for both, the overall percentage of students passing, scores by grade, scores by spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions
